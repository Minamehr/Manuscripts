This directory includes scripts related to exploring "gene-cataluge and metagenome assembeled genome (MAGs) from _Drosophila melanogaster_".

Part1: Preprocessing

Includes metagenomic data preprocessing and assembly: Trimming reads and removing host reads (_Drosophila melanogaster_), generating high-quality sequences. Then assemble short reads into long contigs. 

Part2: Gene calling

This part includes steps for predicting viral contigs.

Part3: MAGs

The discovered viral contigs were checked for redundancy and virus metagenome-assembled genomes were constructed

Part4:Taxonomy and host assignment

This part includes steps of protein clustering, taxonomy of viral contigs, and host assignment of viral contigs
